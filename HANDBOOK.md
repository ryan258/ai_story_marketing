## 7. Troubleshooting Guide

Here are some common issues students might face and how to resolve them:

1. **Story generation is slow:** Remind students to be patient, as AI sometimes takes a moment to think. If it's unusually slow, try refreshing the page.

2. **AI generates inappropriate content:** While rare, immediately report this to the technical support team. Use it as a teachable moment about AI limitations and the importance of human oversight.

3. **Students are stuck on story ideas:** Encourage them to use the AI's "random idea generator" feature or to combine two unrelated objects or concepts for a unique prompt.

4. **Difficulty understanding AI feedback:** Break down the AI's suggestions into simpler terms. Use this as an opportunity to improve reading comprehension skills.

5. **Technical glitches:** Ensure all browsers are up-to-date. If issues persist, contact technical support.

Remember, troubleshooting is part of the learning process. Encourage students to approach problems with curiosity and persistence!

## 8. Accessibility Considerations

To ensure all students can participate fully:

- Use screen readers compatible with the AI Story Creator interface.
- Provide alternative text descriptions for any images or diagrams used in the course.
- Offer voice-to-text options for students who have difficulty typing.
- Ensure all video content used has accurate captions.
- Provide printable versions of digital materials for students who work better with physical copies.
- Allow for flexible deadlines and project formats to accommodate different learning needs.

## 9. Collaborative Learning Opportunities

Encourage collaboration and peer learning through:

- Paired programming sessions where students take turns using the AI tool.
